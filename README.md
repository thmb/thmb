I am looking for remote opportunities to collaborate in projects involving data science and software development, with special interest in blockchain platforms and mathematical techniques.

I have been working with data intelligence and software development for the past 15 years, building web and mobile apps while interacting with startups, large enterprises and government. Currently, I work as a full stack data engineer in a small company I founded in Brazil and I have a residence and work permit in Spain.

My expertise and interests include big data analytics, artificial intelligence, distributed systems and agile software development. I have a strong mathematical background, coding proficiency, knowledge of (non) relational databases, resilient messaging systems, experience with virtualization and cloud services. I enjoy multicultural teamwork and continuous learning.
